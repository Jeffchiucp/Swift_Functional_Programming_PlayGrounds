# Swift_Functional_Programming_PlayGrounds

PlayGrounds that allows users to think about Swift2.0.

With Swift, functional programming techniques become a viable and important part of your programming toolkit.
Definition: functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes calculations via mathematical-style functions, immutability and expressiveness, and minimizes the use of variables and state.

When making the transition from Objective-C to Swift, itâ€™s logical to map concepts you know in Objective-C onto Swift. You know how to create classes with Objective- C, and now you know the equivalent in Swift. There are, of course, some completely new features, such as generics and range operators.
